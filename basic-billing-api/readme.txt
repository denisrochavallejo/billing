1. BasicBilling.API works:
- With 4 entities: Service, Client, Bill and Billing. It has implementation for all CRUD operations on all these entities.
- When a Bill is created (with service categery and period) new Billings are created for all clients.
- Please find attached a Postman collection with examples to use BasicBilling.API

2. In order to build this app please follow next steps in BasicBilling.API folder:
- execute 'dotnet run'

3. Explain which parts you were not able to accomplish and why
- It is always good to learn new things and this was a good experience since it is my first API implementation
- I couldn't create unit test
